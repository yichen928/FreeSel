# Towards Free Data Selection with General-Purpose Models
This repo is official code implementation for our NeurIPS 2023 paper "Towards Free Data Selection with General-Purpose Models". 

## Update
+ [2023-9-21] ðŸ”¥Our paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2023!ðŸ”¥
+ [2022-3-20] An updated version is released with better efficiency, stability, and performance.
+ [2022-2-23] Code for object detection task is available.

## TL;DR

Existing active learning work follows a cumbersome pipeline by repeating the time-consuming model training and batch data selection multiple times on each dataset separately. We challenge this status-quo by proposing a novel general and efficient active learning (GEAL) method in this paper. Utilizing a publicly available model pre-trained on a large dataset, our method can conduct data selection processes on different datasets with a single-pass inference of the same model.

Our method is significantly more efficient than prior arts by hundreds of times, while the performance is competitive or even better than methods following the traditional pipeline.

## Installation

This codebase has been developed with CUDA 11.2, python 3.7, PyTorch version 1.7.1, and torchvision 0.8.2.  Please install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) according to the instruction on the official website, and run the following command to install other necessary modules.

```
pip install -r torchextractor==0.3.0 pillow
```

You also need to install **[ kmeans_pytorch](https://github.com/subhadarship/kmeans_pytorch)** from the source code. *You would get a wrong version if directly installing it through pypi.*

```
git clone https://github.com/subhadarship/kmeans_pytorch
cd kmeans_pytorch
pip install --editable .
```

## Data Selection

Please follow the steps in our [instruction](data_selection) for data selection.

## Downstream Tasks

+ **Object Detection**: Please follow the steps in our [instruction](downstream/detection) for object detection downstream task.
+ **Image Classification**: Please follow the steps in our [instruction](downstream/classification) for image classification downstream task.

## Credits

+ The K-Means module comes from [kmeans_pytorch](https://github.com/subhadarship/kmeans_pytorch).
+ The transformer backbone follows [dino](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino).
+ The downstream object detection task code comes from [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
+ The downstream image classification task code comes from [mmclassification](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification).
